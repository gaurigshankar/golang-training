type       |    value
-----------------------
value           value & pointer
pointer         pointer


From Bill Kennedy

Receivers         Values
----------------------------------------
(t T)             T and *T
(t *T)            *T



In the example if you see 04_pointer_receiver_value_type, you will get error while running the program

This is because, the area func of circle expects a pointer in the receiver
where as we pass value of circle to the info()

So this does not work, where as other 3 examples works
