concurrency vs parallelism

concurrency :: independent process

parallelism :: may be related process


Every parallelism is concurrency but not every concurrency is parallelism


“Concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes,
while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.
Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
 Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.”
